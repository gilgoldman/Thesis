% Abstract in English
\begin{abstract-english}
 As balance and posture problems can be a sign of other medical conditions, as well as affect the day to day routine of people who suffer from them, it is important to keep watch for signs of balance deterioration.\\
 The drive of this project was to create an algorithm which will collect data from Nintendo Wii platforms, analyze it, and provide us with useful results to study in order to gain more knowledge about the subjects balance.\\
 The experiment consist of performing the Romberg test once with open eyes and again with closed eyes while standing on two Nintendo Wii Balance Boards. The data is collected then and statistically analyzed by a customized algorithm which was built specifically for the purpose of translating the weight data of the subjects into clear visual representations of their respective center of gravity, as well as the center of pressure for each foot.\\
 The visualization of the results allows the user of the software to clearly see the difference between maintaining balance with open eyes compared to closed eyes.

\section{Introduction}

Equilibrium is defined as a state in which all of the acting forces cancelled by each other, resulting in a stable, balanced system\cite{Physio}.\\
The maintenance of a stable posture in humans is possible due to the subsystems in our body which make up the postural control system.\\
Those subsystems are the Sensory system, which includes the visual and proprioceptive systems, the Central nervous system (CNS), and the muscle – skeletal system\cite{Control}.\\\par

Any disturbance in each of those subsystems can result in balance problems, which can be a result of old age, when balance control tend to degenerates\cite{Control}, as well as of many health conditions and medical procedures such as dizziness, too low or high blood pressure, result of head injury or a stroke, or as a result of neurological surgery for example\cite{Healthline}, and can greatly affect the daily life of the patients, when the fear of falling which might result in injury accompany daily activities such as standing up or walking\cite{Control}. Also, a change in a patient's usual balance can indicate the existing of an undiagnosed health problem like ear infection, unbalanced chemicals in the brain or even a tumor (acoustic neuroma)\cite{Healthline}.\\
Existing treatments includes medication, physical therapy, exercises at home and even surgery if needed \cite{Healthline}, and the sooner the change is detected – the better treatment the patient can get \cite{Gait}.\\\par

For those reasons it is important to measure the balance of a patient on a regular basis, but as for today, each existing mean have their own pros and cons; 
Scales, such as the Berg Balance scale, are the more common way to measure balance. But while cheaper and easy to use, they are not so accurate or sensitive to small changes, and have measurements limitations\cite{Gait}. \\
Therefore, in special medical facilities for gait and posture for example, it will be more common to find force platforms (FP), which in turn are more accurate and sensitive than a regular scale, but also expensive, not easy to set up, heavy and hard to transport, and as a result not so common in the average medical facilities\cite{Gait}.\\ 
Existing research\cite{Gait}found that if not as precise as the FP, especially in cases where extreme momentum involved, the results measured from Nintendo Wii Balance Boards (WBB) are similar enough to the results obtained from the FP to consider using the WBB as a reliable, easy to access, cheaper and portable way to measure balance in standard, non-specialist clinics, allowing better monitoring of the patient's balance over time and an improved detection of balance changes.\\\par   

While the Nintendo WBB can be a good solution for measuring balance in non-specialized medical facilities, exist a need for a platform which will be a clear and easy way to connect to WBB to computer, analyze the data, and give understandable results, in order to start utilizing them


\subsection{Aim of the project}
The aim of this project is to create an algorithm in Matlab which, when the software is connected to a pair of Nintendo Wii Balance Boards, could use the received data from the measurements and by calculating different parameters such as the center of pressure and center of gravity, will assess the standing balance of the person standing on them, giving an accurate report of their current balance condition.

In this project, a Matlab algorithm was created and used to collect and analyze the data acquired from performing a Romberg test on subjects standing on a pair of Nintendo Wii balance board platforms. 

\section*{Subjects}
This project uses measurements from 5 subjects; 3 males and 2 females, aged 25-35. All of the subjects were all normal volunteers, both students and employees from the FBME faculty in Kladno, Czech Republic, which personally agreed to take part in the measurements.

\section{Equipment}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Matlab R2018a (MathWorks, Massachusetts, United States)
	\item Two Nintendo Wii Balance Boards RVL-021 (Nintendo Co. Ltd., Japan)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Calibration}
For calibration, the offsets of both platforms were taken and then subtract from each platform accordingly before the subject's measuring process begun
\pagebreak
\subsection{Equipment Set-up}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The two Balance boards are positioned next to each other, with a 77 mm gap between them. 
	\item The dimensions of each platform are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Width = 238 mm
		\item Length = 433 mm
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

	\caption{Wii Balance Boards set up}
\end{figure}


\section{Measurement procedure}
\subsection{Complications during the procedure}
While working on the software, there were unforeseen complications, for example, I could not get my computer to work with the libraries that connect between the platforms and the computer, no matter what I have tried – working with different versions of Matlab, trying different . Net frameworks or working from another computer with different Bluetooth driver, nothing solve it and I kept getting the following error code – 0xe0434352.\\
As this is a technical problem, I had agreed with my supervisor to temporarily using his laptop, and was able to perform the measurements I needed.\\
I believe that the problem could be due to a difference of windows versions; while I've tried to work with windows 8 and windows 10, my supervisor have windows 7 on his laptop, and since the libraries I have tried to work with are dated to back to 2007\cite{Error}, they might not work well with later version of windows.

\subsection{Romberg's test}
In order to perform the Romberg test (more about it in Appendix 1), the subject is asked to stand on the platforms – left leg at the center of the left platform and right leg at the center of the right platform, hands are relaxed at the sides of the body, head is at an upright position, looking forward, the subject is then asked to focus their stare on a marker sign, positioned at eye level for each subject and distanced 1.5 meter from the platforms' center.\\
The subject's data is then collected in two cycles of measurements, each time for 60 seconds – first cycle with eyes open, and second with eyes closed.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 0.05]{FullBody}
	\caption{Subject position on the balance boards during the Romberg test}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Collection}
The platforms are connected to a computer via a Bluetooth connection, allowing the software to receive data from the 8 sensors located at the corners of each platform.\\
The data from the sensors is sampled for 60 seconds, at a sampling frequency of 30 Hz, making each measurement cycle yield 1,800 samples from the platforms sensors.\\ 
Those samples are then processed by a designated Matlab script, which computes the subject's center of pressure (CoP) and center of gravity (CoG) from the retrieved data.

\subsection{Methods for Data Analysis}
After receiving the left and right CoP and CoG calculated data from each sample, the code is then analyzing it, calculating the Mean, Median and Standard deviation of the different data x and z coordinates, visualizing the information and allowing a recognition of trends and changes.\\
Another tool used for analyzing the received data is measurements of the Euclidean distance between each point in the vector in order to see how stable on their feet the subject was during both of the tests, the code also calculate the mean and standard deviation of the result, in order to get a better picture of the information.

\chapter{Measurement Results}
\endgroup
The following graphs details the results of the measurements taken, and help us visualize the subjects COP, COG, and their distribution over the course of the measurement. \\ 
The tables depict statistical analysis provided by the algorithm. COP measurements are in relation to each independent board, while the COG measurements are in relation to a unified coordinate system including both boards. In essence, COP (0,0) is the center of the relevant board, while COG (0,0) is the middle point between the two boards, i.e the center of the test set-up.

\chapter{Discussion}

This project was using the data collected from performing the Romberg test on 5 subject, and analyzing it with a code written in Matlab, in order to learn about the subjects balance.\\
While some subjects had better balance then others (subjects 2 and 4 for example), the findings were similar along the measurements, and showed some reoccurring trends.\\
It could be seen that through all the centers of pressure and center of gravity's S.D calculations that the S.D of the Z coordinates was larger than the S.D of the X coordinates, showing that the subjects' movements and swaying in order to keep balanced were mostly forwards and backwards on their feet, and not to the sides.\\
It can also be seen through most of the measurements that the S.D values of the closed eyes measurements were larger than the S.D values of the open eyes measurements, both in the CoP and CoG calculations, and in the Euclidean distance between the points in each vector. This part was expected, since closing eyes eliminates one of the three senses the body requires in order to maintain balance while standing - the vision\cite{Physio}. When all three of those senses are working correctly, the body should not have a problem to remain balanced and any swaying would be minimal. Without the sense of vision, however, the body will lose its balance more often and would have to work harder to keep itself balanced, leading to lager movements back and forth and back to the center again as the body attempts to compensate for the missing sense.\\
Another trend which could be seen from the observed data is the weight alternation between the feet during the test. While the eyes were open, it could be seen from the graphs (figures 15, 21 for example) that the weight is gradually shifted to one foot, usually the dominant one – the right foot in most subjects – a trend which seems to strengthen as time passes. Yet when the eyes are closed, the weight divides almost evenly between the feet and remains that way for the entire test (figures 16, 22 for example).\\
This could be due to the body's need to rely more on other balance mechanisms in order to maintain balance once the vision is eliminated. While dividing body weight equally on two feet can help to keep a sense of space and position, leaning on a single foot could lead to the body losing its balance and falling to the side.\\
During my work I have encountered a limitation that might affect the future using of the code, and would have to be fixed. As stated in the 'Measurements procedure' part in the methods section, the libraries I was trying to use in order to connect the platforms to a computer did not work on my laptop, and therefore I had to run my code and perform the measurements using my code on the laptop of professor Volf – this project's supervisor. This limitation needs to be resolved in order for the code to work on every computer.\\
The collected data and derived statistical analysis shows how much we can learn from testing a person's balance, and how important it is to have a way to follow and monitor this information.\\
The program was created to analyze the collected data, and could allow better monitoring of a person's balance over time and improve detection and treatment of balance changes, and can be expanded in the future for further analysis of the topic.\\

\chapter{Conclusion}
\endgroup

This project showed that the Nintendo Wii Balance boards can be an easy to transport and not expensive option to measure and keep track of people's balance, which can make the act of monitoring and recognizing balance issues on time easier, convenient, and cheaper.\\
I believe that the project can open a way to similar works in the future, focusing on more specific or different data which could be collected from analyzing a person's standing and balance.\\
I myself would try to use this code and platforms, combined with Kinect v2 cameras to examine the correlation between weight and center of pressure to spinal alignment as my thesis work in the future.

\chapter{Romberg's test}

Romberg test is a clinical test, named after the German neurologist Moritz Heinrich Romberg (1795–1873), and was used for over 100 years to assess a person's neurological function of balance\cite{Physio}.\\ 
The test is based on the idea that while our body require 3 senses to keep itself balance while standing, 2 of them are enough to stay balanced, and are able to compensate the missing sense\cite{Physio}.\\ 
The senses are:\\ 
1. Proprioception – the ability to know your body position in space\\
2. Vestibular – the ability to know your head position in space\\
3. Vision – can be used to evaluate and adjust body position \\
\\
The test is checking if there is a problem related to the sense of proprioception, and since a person can still maintain balance based on the other two senses, the subjects in the test are asked to stand still and close their eyes. A healthy patient or a patient which their balance problems are from another source, would be able to maintain upright, using the other two senses – inability to maintain balance and falling down is considered a positive result in the Romberg test\cite{Physio}.\\ 
Having a positive result in the test can point that the patient's ataxia - loss of control of bodily movements – is from a sensory source, and related to the loss of proprioception. A negative result in the test tell us that the source of the ataxia is cerebellar in its nature in case of a patient with the medical condition\cite{Physio}.\\
